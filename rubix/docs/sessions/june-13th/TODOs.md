# Rubix Fleet/Dashboard Build — Blockers & Follow-ups

Append-only log of things an unattended session could NOT do properly and refused to hack. The human
resolves an entry, then strikes it through (`~~...~~`) or deletes it; the loop resets the
corresponding ⛔ row to ⬜ on its next wake.

## Format

```
### <utc-date> — <WS-xx> — <one-line title>
- **What's blocked:** ...
- **Why (the ambiguity / missing dep / guardrail conflict):** ...
- **What the human must decide/provide:** ...
- **Committed so far:** <commit sha or "nothing — clean working tree">
