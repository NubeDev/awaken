# Flow runtime redesign — scope & gaps

Working notes for moving the flow board runtime from a rebuild-per-tick model to a
persistent, Niagara/Sedona-style scan engine with a pushed live-value bus. Captures
(1) how the system works today, (2) the design gaps in the flow↔server seam that the
redesign must close first, and (3) the staged scope.

Source crates: [`rubix-flow`](../../../crates/rubix-flow), the engine wrapper, and
[`rubix-server`](../../../crates/rubix-server) `scheduler/` + `flow/` + `api/boards/`,
the host. UI under [`rubix/ui`](../../../ui) `src/features/flows` + `src/api`.

---

## 1. How it works today

### Engine
The execution engine is **reflow** (`reflow_network` / `reflow_actor` 0.2, external
crates). `rubix-flow` wraps it: a `BoardGraph` (JSON) is loaded into a reflow `Network`
of actors, one per node, wired by the graph's connections. Nodes depend on the host only
through the `PointAccess` trait — `rubix-flow` carries no axum/sqlite/zenoh.

### Execution model — rebuild per tick
`BoardGraph::run` ([`board/run.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/src/board/run.rs)) is a
**single-shot** evaluation:

1. `load(access)` builds a brand-new `Network` with fresh actor instances.
2. `network.start()`.
3. Tick each source node (no inbound connection) once on its first inport.
4. Drain outports every 50ms until a poll yields nothing new (settled) or the 120s budget.
5. `network.shutdown()` — the whole network is destroyed.

The scheduler ([`scheduler/interval.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-server/src/scheduler/interval.rs))
calls this once per interval. So an "every 1s" board **constructs and demolishes the entire
actor network once per second.**

Consequence: actor state cannot survive between ticks. The `trigger` node therefore stashes
its clock/count/level in a process-global `static HashMap`
([`node/trigger/trigger_state.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/src/node/trigger/trigger_state.rs)) —
a workaround for an engine with no persistent state. The repeated `[INPORT CLOSED]` logs are
this teardown/rebuild firing every tick (printed by reflow's `ActorProcess::run` when an inport
closes); they persist until the persistent engine lands.

> **Resolved (load):** reflow's default `NetworkConfig` enables a tracing client that dials a
> `ws://localhost:8080` server on every `Network::start`; no such server runs here, so the
> default produced a reconnect storm — one dial per board build. `BoardGraph::load` now builds
> the network with tracing disabled, so that storm is gone independent of the rebuild model.

### Run modes
Server models three triggers
([`scheduler/trigger.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-server/src/scheduler/trigger.rs)): `Manual`
(HTTP `/run` only), `Interval{seconds}` (min 1s), `Subscription{key}` (fires on a zenoh
keyexpr sample). The UI exposes two ("Continuous — fixed interval" vs "On demand") plus an
Enabled toggle — over-exposed, and redundant with the `trigger` node's own period.

### Live values — REST polling, latest-only
Node outputs are recorded into an in-memory latest-only cache
([`scheduler/outputs.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-server/src/scheduler/outputs.rs)), replaced
wholesale each run. The UI polls `GET /boards/{slug}/outputs` every 5s
([`ui/src/api/hooks.ts`](../../../ui/src/api/hooks.ts)). There is **no SSE or WebSocket
anywhere** in the server or UI. The Points page and Dashboards also poll on the same 5s timer.

### Why live values look buggy/empty
- 5s poll vs variable run cadence → stale (60s board) or missed runs (1s board).
- Manual/disabled boards never populate the cache → endpoint returns `[]` → blank.
- Editing suppresses values: while `dirty`, `liveByNode` returns empty by design
  ([`ui/src/features/flows/index.tsx`](../../../ui/src/features/flows/index.tsx)).
- Test Run sets `lastValues = byNode.get(id)`, which is `undefined` for nodes not in that
  run → wipes them.
- Latest-only cache: one empty run blanks the panel (no last-known-good).

## 2. Design gaps in the flow↔server seam

The seam's **shape is good** and worth keeping: a host-implemented `PointAccess` trait
([`port.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/src/port.rs)) that keeps `rubix-flow` transport-free,
with `bail!`-by-default methods that **fail closed** for unsupported capabilities. The gaps are
that it is **synchronous, pull-only, and untyped at the value/error level** — all of which the
persistent scan engine amplifies and so must be closed before building the scan loop on top.

### G1 — Synchronous seam over async I/O — **closed**
Was: every `read_point` / `write_point` / `query_his` / `query_datasource` /
`request_agent_blocking` was sync, and the host bridged to async with `block_in_place` +
`block_on` ([`flow/access.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-server/src/flow/access.rs) — datasource and
awaited-agent paths), parking a Tokio worker for the whole round-trip, including the **LLM call**
for an awaited `agent_call`.

`PointAccess` is now an `#[async_trait]`; the datasource and agent paths `.await` directly with no
`block_in_place` bridge. `request_agent_blocking` is renamed `request_agent_awaited`. The remaining
SQLite point/history reads still run inline (sync within the async fn) — the same blocking profile
as today, no worse — and should move to `spawn_blocking` (or a dedicated blocking pool) **when the
persistent scan loop lands**, since that loop reads on a cadence rather than once per short-lived run.

### G1a — Cancellation & timeouts on the async seam (open)
Async removes worker-parking but not unboundedness: an awaited `agent_call` or a slow datasource can
still hang forever. The seam needs a deadline/cancellation discipline — a per-call `tokio::time::timeout`
at the engine boundary, and a cancellation token the scan loop and `watch` streams honor on
engine shutdown — so one stuck call cannot wedge a scan or leak a task. The single-shot `run()` has a
120s settle budget today; the persistent engine has no equivalent yet.

### G2 — Pull-only value model, no subscribe/watch (open)
The seam can only `read_point(one_keyexpr)`. The only event-driven path (the zenoh
`Subscription` trigger) lives in the scheduler, *outside* the seam. A persistent engine would
therefore poll every referenced point every scan — pushing the polling problem one layer down —
and the live-value bus would have nothing push-based to build on. The seam needs a
`watch(prefix) -> Stream` primitive so both the engine and the bus are event-driven.

> **Reconcile with the existing Subscription trigger.** `watch(prefix)` and the scheduler's
> `Subscription { key }` loop ([`scheduler/subscribe.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-server/src/scheduler/subscribe.rs))
> both declare a zenoh subscriber on a keyexpr. If a board both has a `Subscription` trigger and a
> node that `watch`es the same prefix, that is **two** subscribers and double-fires. `watch` must be
> the single subscription substrate: the `Subscription` trigger becomes a `watch` consumer, not a
> parallel path. And `watch(prefix)` must be **tenant-scoped** (org/site), or a board could subscribe
> to another tenant's points — the same authz boundary `ScopedPointAccess` already enforces on reads.

### G3 — Link values carry no quality/status/units
Outputs are a lossy `serde_json::Value::from(msg)`
([`board/run.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/src/board/run.rs)). Niagara/Sedona links carry a
status flag (`ok / stale / fault / null / overridden`) on every value; here the only status
signal is a separate `error` outport. The retained-link-value model needs a `{value, quality, ts}`
shape, or a stale retained value is indistinguishable from a fresh one — turning "sometimes empty"
into "sometimes silently wrong."

### Lower-priority (address as those paths are touched)
- **G4 — `anyhow` across a stable seam — closed.** Replaced with a typed `FlowAccessError`
  (`Unsupported` / `Denied` / `Store`) ([`error.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/src/error.rs)), landed
  alongside the G1 async reshape. `NotFound` is deferred until the store layer types its own lookup
  errors — today a missing keyexpr is `Store` and a point with no current value is `Ok(None)`.
- **G5 — `write_point` is fire-and-forget**: no writer provenance (board/run id), no slot
  lease/expiry, no device-accepted confirmation. A persistent engine re-commanding every scan
  wants idempotent lease semantics.
- **G6 — `PointAccess` is a god-trait** (points + sparks + agent + datasource + rules); capability
  is discovered at call-time via `bail!` rather than the type system. Could split into focused
  traits. Cleanliness, not a blocker.

## 2b. Keystone spike + review findings (verified against the crate)

The redesign rested on one unverified assumption. It is now spiked against `reflow_network` 0.2.1
itself (source read + an executable test,
[`tests/persistent_network_spike.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/tests/persistent_network_spike.rs)).

**Keystone — confirmed.** A started `Network` *does* support a persistent model with no per-tick
rebuild:
- `Network::start` spawns one long-lived Tokio task per node (`ActorProcess::run`), a loop that
  reads the actor's inport and runs its behavior on each message until the inport closes. It does
  **not** exit after one message. `shutdown()` aborts those tasks.
- `send_to_actor` can be called repeatedly to re-tick a source; `read_actor_output` drains an
  outport non-blocking. Both work on a live network — no `shutdown()` between scans.
- Each actor's `state: Arc<Mutex<dyn ActorState>>` is created once per process and persists across
  loop iterations — so **Stage D's actor-held state is feasible** (the `trigger` state can leave the
  process-global map). No thin persistent-runtime layer over reflow is needed for the core loop.

**Finding 1 — observe link values via the event stream, not `read_actor_output`.** On `start`,
every source actor's outport is consumed by a fan-out forwarder that delivers to downstream inports.
So `read_actor_output` on a *connected* node races the forwarder and reliably yields **only terminal
(no-outbound) nodes** — the existing single-shot `run()` already relies on this (see the comments in
[`tests/board.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/tests/board.rs)). But every wired link emits a
`NetworkEvent::MessageSent { from_actor, from_port, message }` on `Network::get_event_receiver()`.
**That event stream is the complete, race-free tap** for the live-value bus — terminal-node outputs
come from `read_actor_output`, all interior links from `MessageSent`. The spike test asserts both.
The doc's "scan = tick sources + drain outputs" is therefore incomplete; the engine must subscribe
to the event stream.

**Finding 2 — the event channel leaks unless drained.** `network_event_emitter` is an *unbounded*
flume channel the `Network` holds for its lifetime; every `send_to_actor` and every link pushes an
event. Single-shot runs drop the `Network` each tick, so it is GC'd. A **persistent** engine that
never drains `get_event_receiver()` grows without bound. The engine must continuously drain it
(which is convenient — it is also the value source from Finding 1). Only one consumer may drain it
(flume MPMC splits events across receivers).

**Finding 3 — `shutdown()` alone leaks the forwarder tasks.** The fan-out forwarders and per-connector
delivery tasks are bare `tokio::spawn`s, not tracked in `Network::processes`; `shutdown()` aborts only
the actor processes. The forwarders exit only when their channels disconnect, which happens when the
`Network` (holding the outport senders) is **dropped**. So engine teardown/republish must **drop** the
`Network`, not just call `shutdown()`, or every republish leaks tasks.

**Finding 4 — scan overrun / back-pressure.** Even async, if a scan's I/O outlasts the scan period,
ticks pile up. The interval loop today uses `MissedTickBehavior::Skip` — keep that model: at most one
in-flight scan per board, coalesce/skip overruns, and bound each scan with a timeout (G1a).

**Finding 5 — re-commanding writes every scan.** A persistent engine that re-runs `write_point` every
scan pushes a priority-array command (→ history, audit, bus publish) on every cycle even when nothing
changed. This makes G5 a near-term correctness/cost issue, not a deferral: **coalesce unchanged writes**
(command only when value or priority actually changes) before the scan loop ships.

**Finding 6 — engine lifecycle on republish/disable.** Republish must stop the old scan loop, drop the
old `Network` (Finding 3), close the old event drain + broadcast channel, then build the new one — and
SSE subscribers should be reseeded from the snapshot across the swap. Disable must **tear the engine
down**, not merely skip ticks as the interval loop does today.

**Finding 7 — multi-tenant authz on SSE.** `GET /boards/{slug}/outputs/stream` must enforce the same
tenant/capability gate as the REST `/outputs` endpoint; board link values can carry a tenant's point
values, so the stream is tenant-scoped data, not public.

**Finding 8 — testing a time-based persistent engine.** Inject the scan clock/tick source (the
`trigger` node already injects `now: Instant` — extend that pattern) and use `tokio::time::pause`/
`advance` so scan-loop tests are deterministic; assert via the event-stream tap, not sleeps.

## 3. Proposed scope (staged)

Ordered so nothing is thrown away: the persistent network and the seam redesign are the
foundation the rest builds on. No board-level rebuilds after the first stage.

### Stage A — Seam redesign + persistent network (foundation)
- **Done — async seam:** `PointAccess` is `async` with a typed `FlowAccessError` (closes G1, G4);
  the `block_in_place` bridges are gone. The tracing dial is disabled at `load` (no more
  `ws://localhost:8080` storm). The keystone is spiked (§2b).
- **Done — `BoardEngine`** ([`board/engine.rs`](../../../crates/rubix-flow/src/board/engine.rs)):
  owns one started `Network` for the board's lifetime; `spawn_engine` / `scan` / `current_values`.
  `scan` re-ticks the sources and folds link values into a retained per-`(node,port)` snapshot —
  interior links from the `NetworkEvent::MessageSent` tap, terminals from `read_actor_output`
  (Finding 1) — draining the event channel each scan (Finding 2). Dropping the engine tears the
  network down (Findings 3, 6).
- **Done — interval wiring:** `scheduler/interval.rs` builds the engine once and *scans* it every
  `seconds` (the scan rate), rebuilding on a `version` bump (republish) and dropping it on disable.
  The one-shot `run()` stays for subscription, on-demand, and Test Run.
- **Next — `watch(prefix) -> Stream` (G2):** add it to the seam as a `BoxStream` of
  `{keyexpr, value, quality, ts}`, tenant-scoped, with a fail-closed default; fold the scheduler's
  `Subscription` trigger onto it so there is one subscription substrate (§2b / G2).
- **Next — robustness on the scan loop:** bound each scan with a timeout, keep at most one in-flight
  scan (Finding 4, G1a); coalesce unchanged `write_point` commands so a 1 Hz board does not re-push
  the priority array every scan (Finding 5); move SQLite point/history reads to `spawn_blocking`,
  now that the loop reads on a cadence (G1).

### Stage B — Live value bus + SSE
- **Done — server:** `BoardOutputs` holds a per-board `tokio::sync::broadcast`; every `record`
  (scheduled scan, subscription sample, on-demand run) pushes the snapshot, so the stream and the
  REST snapshot share one feed. `clear` pushes an empty frame so a disabled/deleted board blanks
  subscribers. `GET /api/v1/boards/{slug}/outputs/stream` (axum SSE) emits the snapshot on connect
  then each subsequent snapshot, under the same tenant authorization as `/outputs` (Finding 7).
- **Done — UI hook:** `useBoardOutputsStream` reads the stream over `fetch` (native `EventSource`
  can't send the bearer header), retains last-known-good per `(node, port)` so a momentary empty run
  no longer blanks the canvas, and reconnects with backoff. Replaces the 5s poll for live boards.
  Wiring it into the flow editor lives in the working tree alongside unrelated in-flight UI work.
- **Next:** snapshots are full pictures, not yet field-level deltas with `{value, quality, ts}` (G3);
  stop blanking on `dirty` / Test-Run / missing-node and show a freshness age in the editor.

### Stage C — Simplify run modes to enable/disable
- Strip the "Continuous / On demand" dropdown; leave Enabled + an optional advanced **Scan rate**.
  Intra-graph rate stays on the `trigger` node. `Manual` stays server-side for the Test Run button.

### Stage D — Persistent component state (true scan model)
- Migrate `trigger` (and any stateful node) off the process-global `static HashMap` to
  actor-held state, now that actors live across scans. Removes the registry hack and the
  restart-coupling of `boot`.
- Retained link values become the source of truth — each link holds a current value
  continuously, making the live bus complete by construction.

### Stage E — Unify the live bus across the app
- Points page and Dashboards subscribe to the same SSE/zenoh-backed stream instead of 5s
  polling — one real-time substrate for points, board links, and widgets.

### Deferred
- G5 (write provenance/lease) — revisit when wiring the persistent writer.
- G6 (split the god-trait) — opportunistic.

## Dependencies
```
Stage A (async seam + persistent net) ─┬─> Stage B (SSE) ──> Stage C (UX)
                                        └─> Stage D (component state) ──> Stage E (unified bus)
```
Stage A is the keystone; its one real unknown (reflow's long-lived-network behaviour) is now
spiked and confirmed (§2b). The async seam, the `BoardEngine`, and the interval scan wiring have
landed; what remains in Stage A is the `watch` primitive and scan-loop robustness (timeout, write
coalescing, `spawn_blocking`). Stages B–C deliver the visible win (real-time, no flicker, simple
UX); Stages D–E complete the Niagara/Sedona model.
