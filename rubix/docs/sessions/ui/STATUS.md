# Rubix UI Build — Workstream Queue (finish the UI, zero fake data)

Companion queue to the backend queue in [../STATUS.md](../STATUS.md), driven by the same loop
algorithm in [../_ORCHESTRATION.md](../_ORCHESTRATION.md). Branch: **`rubix-gaps`**, sequential,
no worktrees.

## Mission

`rubix/ui` looks right (the operator has signed off on the look) but runs on an in-memory demo
dataset (`src/api/demo/`). The mission is to make every surface read and write the **real**
rubix-server API with **zero fake data in the UI**, without regressing the look.

**The look is frozen.** The current demo-mode rendering is the visual contract: density, dark
theme, KPI sparklines, the labelled priority array, the sparks master-detail, the flows chrome.
"Remove fake data" means *change where data comes from*, never *what populated data looks like*.
The thing that preserves the look with real data is **UI-02** (server-side dev seed): the demo
building moves from TypeScript fixtures into the real store, served by real endpoints.

What counts as fake (the removal targets):
- `ui/src/api/demo/fixtures.ts` + `ui/src/api/demo/index.ts` and the `isDemo()` switch in
  `ui/src/api/endpoints.ts` (defaults ON today).
- `ui/src/features/flows/data/sample-board.ts` (static wiresheet graph).
- Hardcoded UI claims: `board-status-bar.tsx` ("deployed · running", "v4"),
  `sparks/index.tsx` (`agentAttributed={s.rule === 'simultaneous-heat-cool'}`),
  `profile-dropdown.tsx` ("satnaing").
- TS wire types that were *assumed* rather than verified against the server
  (`RunSummary`, `QueryResult`, `PriorityArray` JSON shape, `WriteSource` casing).

What does NOT count as fake (allowed to stay):
- Honest empty/loading/error states when the store genuinely has no data.
- The dev seed (UI-02): real rows in the real store via real endpoints, dev-gated.
- Test fixtures inside `*.test.ts` files (the operator explicitly allows test-only data).

## Queue

Queue order is dependency order. UI-01/UI-02 are prerequisites of UI-03 — **the demo layer must
not be deleted before the seed exists**, or every screenshot regresses to empty states and the
look-freeze gate cannot pass.

## DONE GATE (UI variant — replaces the cargo gate for these rows)

Before marking any UI-xx ✅:
- `pnpm -C rubix/ui build` green (tsc -b + vite build).
- `pnpm -C rubix/ui test:unit` green.
- **Grep gate** (from UI-03 onward):
  `grep -rn "api/demo\|VITE_DEMO\|sample-board" rubix/ui/src --include='*.ts*'` → no hits
  outside `*.test.*`.
- **Look-freeze gate**: with `rubix-server` + seed running, capture
  `scripts/screenshot.mjs` shots of dashboard / points / sparks / flows and eyeball against the
  reference set in `rubix/ui/docs/reference/` (captured by UI-02 before any demo removal).
  A populated page may not lose widgets, density, or chart series vs its reference.
- Backend untouched unless the WS explicitly owns a backend change (only UI-02 does);
  if touched: `cd rubix && cargo test --workspace` + clippy clean.
- Session wrote `Done` + timestamp in its `ui/UI-xx.md`; commit on `rubix-gaps` prefixed `UI-xx:`.

## Charter deltas (in addition to ../\_ORCHESTRATION.md AGENT CHARTER)

- READ FIRST also includes: `rubix/ui/src/api/` (the client), the OpenAPI doc served at
  `/api-docs/openapi.json` (run the server; it is the wire truth), and
  `/home/user/code/rust/starter/rubix/FILE-LAYOUT.md` (file discipline applies to TS too:
  ≤400 lines hard, verb/concept per file, no utils.ts).
- The UI dev loop: `cd rubix && cargo run -p rubix-server` (port 8088) then
  `pnpm -C rubix/ui dev` (port 5180, `/api` proxied). `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` if inotify
  limits bite.
- shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/` are vendored library code — extend variants,
  do not rewrite.
- Never invent a wire field. If the UI needs data the API doesn't expose, that is a TODOs.md
  blocker entry (`../TODOs.md`), not a synthesized value.

## Dependency notes

- **UI-01 → everything**: all later rows assume the client types are the verified wire truth.
- **UI-02 → UI-03**: seed first, delete second (look-freeze depends on it). UI-02 is the only
  row allowed backend changes (a seed path + sim wiring) and must pass the cargo gate too.
- **UI-04/05/06** are independent of each other once UI-03 lands; keep queue order anyway
  (sequential branch discipline).
- **UI-07** last: it deletes/locks things earlier rows still touch.

Cargo gate (UI-04 touched rubix-server seed) NOT confirmable this wake: blocked by foreign untracked `crates/rubix-rules/` + its Cargo.toml edit (another concurrent session's in-flight work, breaks `--workspace` manifest resolution); left untouched per concurrency rule, logged to TODOs.md by subagent. Subagent verified its seed green in isolation before that crate appeared. Row → ✅. Next pending: UI-05.

Subagent fixed a real UI-01 client drift (resume→ResumeResponse, cancel→204, suspended status) — wire-verified, no field invented; no TODOs blockers. Look-freeze not re-captured (no live server this wake; only additive /runs detail route, no populated page reshaped). Foreign backend changes untouched. Row → ✅. Next pending: UI-06.
- 2026-06-12T23:45:13Z spawn — UI-06: no WS 🔵, UI-01..05 ✅, first pending row → spawn fresh UI-06 subagent (Dashboard Builder MVP on `/api/v1/widgets`: widgets CRUD client, palette rail, binder dialog, live canvas, pin-from-points).

Builder stub replaced with real widgets client + palette/binder/live-canvas + pin-from-points; create/render-live/pin against `/api/v1/widgets`, pins are server rows. Two TODOs logged (no DELETE verb on the wire → canvas has no Remove; no layout field → order-by-creation), both genuine missing-backend deps, not hacks. Commits `UI-06:`-prefixed 0aab01a2/a0c3311a.

Real bearer-token auth (token store + Authorization header + 401→clear/redirect, de-axios'd), shadcn template residue stripped (sign-up/otp/forgot/sign-in-2 + no-op settings forms + clerk/brand/coming-soon + cz.yaml/netlify.toml deleted), nav/profile de-fictionalised. No TODOs blockers. Backend + foreign crates untouched. Row → ✅. **Queue complete — UI-01..07 all ✅; loop STOPS, no reschedule.**
